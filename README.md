Individual Project REPORT

INTRODUCTION

As a college tennis player, my passion for the sport extends beyond the court, driving my curiosity to explore its intricacies beyond the confines of matches and training sessions. It was this enthusiasm that led me to embark on a data science project delving into the influence of tennis surfaces on player performance. Drawing from my firsthand experience navigating the diverse terrain of collegiate tennis, I recognized the profound impact that surface types like hard court and clay can have on match outcomes. Intrigued by this dynamic, I sought to delve deeper into the statistical nuances underlying players' win percentages across different surfaces. This project serves not only as an academic endeavor but also as a reflection of my dedication to understanding the multifaceted nature of tennis, both as a player and as an enthusiast of the game.



DATASET

THE DATASET WAS FROM ATP TOUR STATISTICS. I had to manipulate the data so that I could clean it and use the proper stats for the proper surfaces, I also had to retrieve win an loss statistics. 

In constructing this analysis, I collected data sets encompassing match outcomes for prominent tennis players across various surfaces. Each data set represents a comprehensive compilation of matches played by specific players, detailing their victories and total matches contested on hard court and clay surfaces. These data sets provide a granular view of player performance, allowing for the calculation of win percentages on each surface type. By meticulously curating and organizing these data sets, I aimed to capture the nuanced interplay between player prowess and surface suitability, shedding light on how environmental factors influence competitive outcomes in the realm of tennis. This meticulous approach ensures the integrity and reliability of the analysis, laying a robust foundation for drawing insightful conclusions regarding the impact of tennis surfaces on player success.	




HOW?
To complete the code for this analysis, I leveraged two fundamental Python libraries: pandas and matplotlib. The pandas library served as the cornerstone for data manipulation and management, enabling seamless handling of the player match data. With pandas, I structured the data into organized DataFrames, facilitating easy computation of win percentages and surface-wise comparisons. Additionally, matplotlib, a versatile visualization library, empowered the creation of informative bar charts to visualize the win percentages of each player on hard court and clay surfaces. 


FINAL FINDINGS.

Through the analysis conducted in this project, it was found that the performance of tennis players, represented by their win percentages, varied noticeably across different playing surfaces, particularly hard court and clay. Across the three players examined — Novak Djokovic, Jannik Sinner, and Carlos Alcaraz — distinct patterns emerged in their performance on these surfaces. Novak Djokovic exhibited a relatively high win percentage on both hard court and clay, showcasing versatility in adapting to different surfaces. Jannik Sinner demonstrated a strong performance on hard court, while Carlos Alcaraz excelled predominantly on clay. These findings underscore the significant influence of playing surface on player success in tennis and emphasize the importance of surface-specific strategies and skills development for competitive performance.
